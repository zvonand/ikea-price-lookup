## The Detailed Version

### Data Collection
IkeLookup does NOT collect or transmit any personal information.

### What the Extension Does
The extension only:
1. **Reads** product article numbers from IKEA pages you visit
2. **Fetches** public price information from IKEA's public websites (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands)
3. **Displays** this information to you in a tooltip
4. **Caches** price data temporarily in your browser's memory (cleared when you close the browser)

All processing happens **locally in your browser**. No data leaves your device except standard HTTP requests to IKEA's public websites.

### Third-Party Services
This extension does NOT use any third-party services.

### Permissions Explained
The extension:
- **Accesses IKEA.com**: To read product information and display price comparisons
- **Makes web requests**: To fetch public price data from IKEA websites in different countries

These permissions are used ONLY for the extension's core functionality.

### Data Storage
The only data stored is:
- **Temporary cache**: Stored in your browser's memory to avoid repeated requests. Automatically cleared when you close your browser.

### Updates to This Policy
If we ever change how the extension works, we'll update this policy. Given that we collect absolutely nothing, changes are unlikely.
